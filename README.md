#I created an ASCII hangman game in C++, using the Linux telnet program PuTTY and the emacs program editor. 

#The game begins by greeting the user and uploading a list of words with which to play. It randomly chooses a word, counts the of letters in the word, and provides the appropriate number of underscores underneath an ASCII hangman's noose. A visual alphabet is also provided for the player's convenience.

#The player takes turns entering a letter to guess. If it is in the word, the underscore is replaced with the letter. If not, part of an ASCII stick figure will appear in the hangman's noose! Every time a letter is chosen, it is removed from the visual alphabet. This repeats until either the game is won (the word is guessed) or lost (the figure is hanged). 

#Statistics are updated after each game. Users can see how many words are available, how many of these words have been unused, and the number of losses and wins.
